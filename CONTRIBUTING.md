## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+**: [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gocat.git
   cd gocat
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/realibrahimsql/Gocat.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```

4. **Verify setup**

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the latest version** to ensure the bug still exists
3. **Gather information** about your environment

When creating a bug report:

1. Use our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
2. Provide a **clear title** and **detailed description**
3. Include **steps to reproduce** the issue
4. Add **system information** (OS, architecture, Go version)
5. Include **log output** if applicable
6. Add **screenshots** if relevant

### Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! When suggesting a feature:

1. Use our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)
2. **Describe the problem** you're trying to solve
3. **Explain your proposed solution** in detail
4. **Consider alternatives** and explain why your solution is best
5. **Provide examples** of how the feature would be used

### Contributing Code

#### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable release branch
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes for production

#### Workflow

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow our coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

- **Use `gofmt`** for formatting
- **Follow `golint`** recommendations
- **Use meaningful names** for variables and functions
- **Write clear comments** for complex logic
- **Keep functions small** and focused
- **Handle errors properly** - don't ignore them

├── .github/            # GitHub workflows and templates
└── Makefile           # Build automation
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Packages**: lowercase, single word when possible
- **Files**: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `connection_handler.go`)
- **Functions**: CamelCase, exported functions start with capital
- **Variables**: camelCase for local, CamelCase for exported
- **Constants**: ALL_CAPS with underscores
- **Interfaces**: end with "-er" when possible (e.g., `Handler`, `Reader`)

### Comments

- **Package comments**: Describe the package purpose
- **Function comments**: Start with function name, describe what it does
- **Complex logic**: Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **TODO comments**: Include issue number when possible

```go
// Package connection provides network connection management utilities.
package connection

// Handler manages network connections and provides methods for
// establishing, maintaining, and closing connections.
type Handler interface {
    // Connect establishes a connection to the specified address.
    // It returns an error if the connection cannot be established.
    Connect(address string) error
}
```

### Error Handling

- **Always handle errors** - don't use `_` to ignore them
- **Wrap errors** with context using `fmt.Errorf`
- **Use custom error types** for specific error conditions
- **Log errors** at appropriate levels

```go
// Good
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to do something: %w", err)
}

// Bad
doSomething() // ignoring error
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage

- **Aim for 80%+ coverage** for new code
- **Test both happy path and error cases**
- **Include edge cases** and boundary conditions
- **Use table-driven tests** for multiple scenarios

### Test Structure

```go
func TestConnectionHandler_Connect(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        address string
        want    error
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid address",
            address: "localhost:8080",
            want:    nil,
        },
        {
            name:    "invalid address",
            address: "invalid",
            want:    ErrInvalidAddress,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            h := NewHandler()
            got := h.Connect(tt.address)
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("Connect() = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Test Types

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Benchmark tests**: Performance testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run a specific package's tests
go test ./internal/session/

# Run benchmarks
make test-bench

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```
